# What is this

I am so interested in malware dev in general but throughout my malware dev journey (which just started) i realized how important os internals are and thats when i had the idea of making my own operating system which is a huge project but m pretty sure i will learn some crutial stuff that il need later on 

i don't know how long it will take but il try my best to actually complete this project 

i have no idea from where to start or what m getting my self into but m excited and il document everything i do here in this repo
